          Make sure you take all the important specifications of your TV into account before deciding on a bracket. This includes the size, weight, and manufacturer’s mounting recommendations. If you are planning to mount your TV high up on a wall make sure that you get something long enough to do this properly. Also, pay attention to where the bolts go to know whether or not they will fit into your wall studs or if you need anchors. Finally, decide how much weight the bracket can support based on what type of TV you have so that it won’t break under pressure. Mounting hardware is usually included with standard brackets so keep an eye out for anything else that might come packaged separately when shopping around. Most brackets are made to support screens up to 27-inches but this can vary depending on the bracket type. A good bracket can transform a room into a theater-like environment, which makes it worth paying attention to what type you choose. Here are some things to consider when choosing one:

              Weight Capacity
            </h2>
            <p>
              The first thing to look at is how much weight the <a href="https://latvmounters.com/what-do-you-need-to-know-before-hiring-a-tv-mounting-service/">mounting</a> bracket will support before it fails or becomes unstable. This number should be clearly stated by the manufacturer but typically ranges from 50lb to 200lbs depending on the size and material used in construction.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a smart idea to find out the weight of your TV, PVR/DVR, and any other devices you have attached to it before deciding on a bracket. An empty TV stand can hold much more than one full of equipment so if you know the weight, either individually or as an average, choose a mount that works for it (obviously don’t load your brand new plasma with bricks).

        <h2>
          Material Quality
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are many types of materials used in manufacturing brackets including metal, plastic, steel, and wood among others. Each material has its respective strengths and weaknesses in terms of durability, weight capacity, looks, and cost. Metal brackets are the most durable, but are bulky and have a cheap look. Wood is popular because it looks great, but it must be carefully maintained to avoid warping or splitting. It also cannot support much weight. Plastic brackets are lightweight and can handle more weight than wood, but they tend to look cheap and may not last for very long.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important thing to consider when choosing between materials is where you plan on placing your <a href="https://latvmounters.com/services/tv-brackets/">TV bracket</a>. All materials function well in living rooms except for plastic that tends to look tacky in this location. If you place your TV in a room other than the living room make sure your choice can stand up to moisture levels found in these locations such as the kitchen or bathroom without warping over time.

        <h2>
          Design
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are many designs available when it comes to TV brackets. The most common ones include flat-screen and articulating models. Flat-screen brackets allow you to easily install the TV and keep it level, but they don’t allow you much flexibility for movement so that you can get the best viewing angle. Articulating mounts, on the other hand, give you tilt and swivel capabilities for easy viewing from any location in a room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Space-saving designs are also common in the TV bracket world. If you’re short on floor space, putting your TV up on a wall can be a good option, since it will free up room below the screen for other uses or decorations. Some mounts can even rotate so that they’ll hold your TV vertically when necessary. This is helpful if you want to mount the TV over something like an aquarium or fireplace.

              Installation
            </h2>
            <p>
              Most types of TV <a href="https://latvmounters.com/how-do-i-choose-a-tv-wall-mount/">wall mount</a> brackets attach either directly to a wall or by using extension arms that provide added support and stability while holding the screen in place. Extension arms come in fixed or adjustable options, which are good if you have high ceilings or want to put the TV at eye level for easier viewing. Brackets that attach directly to the wall are more stable, but they may require two people to install correctly due to their weight and size.
            </p>
            <p>
              The installation process is one of the most critical aspects of choosing a bracket because it <a href="https://latvmounters.com/how-do-you-determine-what-type-of-tv-wall-mount-is-best-for-your-space/">determines how likely your TV will stay on the wall</a> over time. Also, consider where you intend to attach the brackets before shopping for one to <a href="https://latvmounters.com/what-to-do-to-ensure-the-mounted-tv-stays-secure/">ensure they can be mounted</a> properly.

        <h2>
          Stands vs Wall Mounts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Wall mount TVs offer many advantages over the standard stand mount, including being easier to install and more customizable in terms of height adjustment. In most cases, they also provide better sound quality by eliminating the speaker from below your television set. On the other hand, some people prefer a stand-mounted TV for aesthetic reasons or because they want their TV on top of furniture such as an entertainment center. Stand-mounted TVs can also sometimes be cheaper than equivalent wall-mount units. The choice between a stand <a href="https://latvmounters.com/how-to-choose-the-right-tv-wall-mount-for-your-room/">mount and a wall mount</a> is often one that’s made based on personal preference – but whichever type you choose, you can benefit from selecting the right type of mount bracket for your specific TV.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stand mount is exactly what it sounds like: a wall-mounted stand that holds your television in place on top of a standard table or other types of furniture. This type of mount is by far the most common choice for consumers because they provide excellent flexibility and ease of use, especially when compared to wall mounts. They are also less expensive than their wall-mounted counterparts, allowing you to save money while still getting an easy installation experience with a high-performance product. The best part about a stand mount however is its range of adjustability. You can often adjust not only the height but also the width and depth, giving you unprecedented flexibility in terms of where you place your TV. This is especially useful if you want to install the screen in an odd-shaped corner or inside a piece of furniture.
